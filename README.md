# Rock-paper-scissors

## Understand the ask

Create a blank HTMl page and link a Javascript extenral file and print something there

#### Plan
- Interface : IDE
- Input : No input from user
- output : Code executed in the console.log()

#### Pseudocode 
- Create a folder in the local machine 
- open that folder in vscode
- create two files, one html and one js file 
- Link the Js file from html file
- Insert a console.log() code line in the js file 
- Excecute that using live preview and view the code in the browser console

#### Divide and conquer 
- Task 1 : Create a folder 
- Task 2 : open the folder in vs code
- Task 3 : Create a html file with boiler code
- Task 4 : Create a js file and link this in html 
- Task 5 : insert a code in JS file 
- Task 6 : Check the output and alter the code accordingly
